This repository contains three C# console applications:

1. **Grade Calculator**
2. **Ticket Price Calculator**
3. **Triangle Type Identifier**

**Grade Calculator**
This program calculates the letter grade corresponding to a numerical grade entered by the user.

Features:
Prompts the user to enter a numerical grade between 0 and 100.
Validates user input to ensure it's within the valid range.
Calculates the letter grade based on a grading scale:
90 and above: A
80-89: B
70-79: C
60-69: D
Below 60: F
Displays the corresponding letter grade to the user.

Usage:
Compile the program (instructions specific to your chosen compiler).
Run the program.
Enter a numerical grade between 0 and 100 when prompted.
The program will display the corresponding letter grade.

**Ticket Price Calculator**
This program calculates the movie ticket price based on the customer's age.

Features:
Prompts the user to enter their age.
Validates user input to ensure it's a valid age.
Calculates the ticket price based on the following criteria:
Standard price: GHC10 (defined as a constant)
Discounted price: GHC7 (defined as a constant) for senior citizens (age 65 and above) and children (age 12 and below)
Displays the calculated ticket price to the user.

Usage:
Compile the program (instructions specific to your chosen compiler).
Run the program.
Enter your age when prompted.
The program will display the corresponding ticket price.

**Triangle Type Identifier**
This program determines the type of a triangle based on the lengths of its three sides entered by the user.

Features:
Prompts the user to enter the lengths of three sides of a triangle.
Validates user input to ensure the entered lengths can form a valid triangle (triangle inequality).
Determines the triangle type based on the side lengths:
Equilateral: All three sides are equal.
Isosceles: Two sides are equal.
Scalene: No sides are equal.
Displays the identified triangle type to the user.
Usage:

Compile the program (instructions specific to your chosen compiler).
Run the program.
Enter the lengths of the three sides of a triangle (one at a time) when prompted.
The program will display the type of the triangle.
